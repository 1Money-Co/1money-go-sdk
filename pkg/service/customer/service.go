 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

// Package customer provides customer account management and KYB (Know Your Business) services.
//
// This package implements the customer service client for the 1Money platform, enabling
// creation and management of business customer accounts with comprehensive KYB compliance.
//
// # Overview
//
// The customer service handles:
//   - Business customer account creation with full KYB information
//   - Beneficial ownership tracking and verification
//   - Business address management (registered and physical)
//   - Risk assessment and compliance documentation
//   - Associated person management (owners, directors, signers)
//
// # Basic Usage
//
// Create a customer service instance and use it to create customer accounts:
//
//	import (
//	    "context"
//	    "github.com/1Money-Co/1money-go-sdk/internal/transport"
//	    "github.com/1Money-Co/1money-go-sdk/pkg/service/customer"
//	)
//
//	// Initialize transport with credentials
//	t := transport.New(accessKey, secretKey)
//
//	// Create customer service
//	svc := customer.NewService(t)
//
//	// Prepare customer creation request
//	req := &customer.CreateCustomerRequest{
//	    BusinessLegalName:          "Acme Corporation",
//	    BusinessDescription:        "Technology services provider",
//	    BusinessRegistrationNumber: "1234567890",
//	    Email:                      "contact@acme.com",
//	    BusinessType:               "corporation",
//	    BusinessIndustry:           "technology",

//	    },
//	    DateOfIncorporation: "2020-01-15",
//	    // ... additional fields
//	}
//
//	// Create the customer
//	resp, err := svc.CreateCustomer(context.Background(), req)
//	if err != nil {
//	    // Handle error
//	}
//
// # KYB Compliance
//
// The customer creation process requires comprehensive KYB information including:
//   - Business registration and incorporation details
//   - Beneficial ownership information (persons with >25% ownership)
//   - Ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs)
//   - Business purpose and source of funds/wealth
//   - Risk assessment data (high-risk activities, money services)
//   - Supporting documentation (certificates, agreements, IDs)
//
// # Associated Persons
//
// All business customers must provide information about associated persons who have:
//   - Ownership stake (typically >25%)
//   - Control over business operations
//   - Signing authority
//   - Director or officer positions
//
// Each associated person requires:
//   - Full legal name and contact information
//   - Date of birth and nationality
//   - Residential address
//   - Government-issued ID documents
//   - Tax identification information
//
// # Data Privacy
//
// This package handles sensitive personal and business information. All data should be:
//   - Transmitted over secure HTTPS connections
//   - Encrypted at rest when stored
//   - Handled in compliance with applicable privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
//   - Accessed only by authorized personnel
//
// # Error Handling
//
// All service methods return errors that can be inspected for specific failure conditions.
// Common error scenarios include:
//   - Invalid or incomplete KYB information
//   - Duplicate business registration numbers
//   - Failed document verification
//   - Network or authentication errors
//
// Always check returned errors and handle them appropriately.
